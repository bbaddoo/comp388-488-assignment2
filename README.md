# Personal Webpage
Brief description: My website is very simple. I made sure not to focus too much on how the website looked but focused on how it works with git and vercel. My website has its header, three sections of text with their own headers with a color block behind them. The first header also has rounded corners while the other 3 do not so have some obvious separation between the columns which I did with css. Then, with javascript, I made a button that when you click it, it says “I hope you are doing well!”
I learned a lot from this project. First, I learned that my laptop is OLD which I did not think would have been an issue but when it came to git/ git hub it was.There’s nothing I can do about that so I had to install an older version on my terminal for things to start working again. I also learned that vercel is very picky. At first, I had all of my files in their own separate folder and vercel was only able to recognize my html file since that is where the root directory was pointed at. So, I moved the js and css files into the html folder for the website to work. I had a lot of trial and error so I was committing things to github a lot to see what would work and what wouldn’t. Also, at first vercel made a duplicate repository which I did not want to do. I had to go back and connect it to the right depository for the new one I made for the website. Overall, pretty cool. I now can see how much detail someone can add into making a website and also how long it can take to add certain elements.
